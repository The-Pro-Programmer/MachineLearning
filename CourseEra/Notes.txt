Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn without explicitly programmed
Machine learning is a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
Knowingly unknowingly AI/ML touches  various aspects of our lives
Examples:
	Computer vision
	Amazon, Netflix recommendations
	Database mining for large data sets
	Understanding human behavior

Type of machine learning algorithms
	Supervised Learning
	Unsupervised learning
	Reinforcement Learning
	Recommender System

Supervised Learning
	Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output.
	Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining
		Classification
		Regression
		
	Regression:
		Continuous valued output is provided
		
	Classification
		Discrete valued output is provided
	
Unsupervised Learning
	Data is not labeled
	Data can be clustered

Model and Cost Function
Model Representaion
	We feed training dataset to learning algorithms
	h:	Hypethesis / Learning algorithm
	x:	Input
	y:	Estimated Output
	"h maps x to y"
