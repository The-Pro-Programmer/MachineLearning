Types of chatbots:
    Retrieval based chatbot
    Generated response based / self learning chatbot

Terms:
    RNN: Recurring Neural Network
    LSTM: Long Short Term Memory

LSTM:
    Long Short - Term Memory
    Improved version of RNN
    Unlike RNN, LSTM holds memory cell to store information for a longer duration

Chatbot architecture:
    NLP Layer
    Knowlege base / CMS
    Data Store
    Encoder - Deocer Model

Development plan:
    Package installation
    Defining chat Model
    Tokenization
    Setting-up Encoder-Decorder
    Implementing RNN based model Development
    Training, Testing, Validating chatbot outcomes
